Part 1:
1. d. x = 4 and y = 3

2. a. Where x = 3 and y = 5, y = 1 after entering the switch
   b. Where x = 2 and y = 5 at the beginning, y = 1

3. The output was 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 though it run through the loop body 10 times.

4. There is no output. The condition set does not allow entry into the loop because the a part of the code does not qualify to get into the loop.
